# My Programing Showcase. 

I have been in programming for 2 years now, and here is a preview of my programing projects thus far. 

## Calculator
 I did this project in programing one, this was my first large scale project and my favorite project that i did. It was filled with many steps, but in the end, it was well worth it. I started with a layout of what I wanted my calculator to do, and how I wanted it to look. This is what my layout looked like, I just wrote it out:

After the layout I began to code the application, I started with 2 function buttons and the display. During the making of this calculator I learned what classes were and how to use them. I also learned how to make a complex program, that had many aspects that worked together.  I got a working calculator (mostly :):) I still want to code 4 function buttons with square root, exponents, etc. I will just add that sometime in the future;) that I could potentially use! It took awhile to get a hang of the program, but in the end it was well worth it!

## Tanker App
One of the first applications that I completed in programing 2 was my Tanker App. In order to produced this app I used an onine compiler called [repl.it]( https://repl.it/repls " Link to the repl.it website ")  The programing language used to create this App was java. This Program can calculate the amount of water you will drink throught your life time in tanker trucks. This programing application introduced me to a new concept, the Scanner in function. This function allows the user to input their own information into the code. This function allowed me to make the program more adaptable and individual. When finished, the application could figure out with an inputed number of years and water intake per day the estimated amount of tanker trucks you could drink in your life.

## Date Calculator

This is a program I completed close to the earlier part of programing 2. This application can calculate any day in the future or in the past, coded using java. For this project I had to figure out how to reaserch diffrent functions for applications, I had to navigate the java database and find the function that could get me the correct date and time, this function is: .getDayOfWeek and LocalDate. Overall this project was very fun and exiting.

## Resturant Bill Calculator

This application is a program that can determine the amount you have to pay at a resturant. It takes into the account the amount you spent for food, the amount tip you want to leave the waiter, and the number of people who will be splitting the bill in your party. This is an application which uses the variable type Double, as well as caculations for specific values.

## Time Zone App

This application can find out the time in your time zone as well as the time in other time zones. This application taught me how to reaserch on the java database to find diffrent time funtions. This project uses for statments and embeded if statements.

## AP American History Study

One of the most complex projects that I did, was a project to help someone study for the AP American History test. This program allows students to review each period of time while memorizing where these things happened on a map of America. Once finished with looking at the map students can then transfer to a diffrent screen which summurizes in a story the things they learned in that period of time. This program is an object oriented program with 4 classses with differing inheritence. This project was super fun and helped me to bring together topics I learned in programing 1 with topics I learned in programing 2.
